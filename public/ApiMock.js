/*
This is a global publish/subscribe channel object definition.
It was introduced to allow for a communication between various parties in stores using various widget technologies and AllexisSDK as well.
It is supposed to be independent, not a part of a component (even though in this POC it is in the same repository).
Idea is inspired from Backbone's `Radio` object (aka `Channel`).

Even though, for a react-like components, a state machine like Redux would be more convenient solution,
Pub/sub mechanism like this has advantages in:
- being much smaller that Redux\
- being easily accessible from any technology, as it is Vanilla and bases on callbacks
- doesn't require to move state from AllexisSDK or old widgets to a new state container (as it only allow for communication, and doesn't preserve any state itself)

Disadvantages:
- no single source of truth
- to unsubscribe, component classes need to preserve a reference to a callback function
- because often it will be a class method, the easiest way I've figured out is to pass `this` and use it as a scope for further callback call
- the above ones make it less convenient and not leveraging React to full extend, as Redux would

There's a lot of room for improvements, though:
- Improving the managment of a scope of callbacks
- Additional methods may be needed later on, to i.e. reset an event name completely, or even reset the whole channel; caching; ...
- Each object/component could be a channel transmitter, so that they don't need a single communication object and every object could be listenedOn (as it is in Backbone)

    console.log(`Published ${name} with ${JSON.stringify(params)}`)

    else console.log(`Unhandled event ${name}`)
